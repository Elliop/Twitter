# Twitter Clone with React.js (Next.js, Tailwind CSS)

This is a Twitter clone project built with React.js, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS. It aims to replicate some of the core features of Twitter, including user authentication, posting tweets, deleting tweets, viewing others' tweets, and interacting with them through likes and comments.

## Features

- **User Authentication:** Users can log in to the application using their Google account, leveraging the Google Sign-In API for secure and convenient authentication.

- **Posting Tweets:** Authenticated users can compose and publish new tweets. These tweets will be displayed on the user's profile and in the main feed.

- **Deleting Tweets:** Users have the ability to delete their own tweets if they no longer wish to keep them visible.

- **Viewing Others' Tweets:** Users can explore tweets from other users on the main feed. These tweets will be displayed in a chronological order, allowing users to stay updated with the latest posts.

- **Likes and Comments:** Users can engage with tweets by liking them or leaving comments. This promotes interaction and enables users to express their opinions on specific posts.

## Tech Stack

The project is built using the following technologies:

- **React.js:** A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It provides a component-based architecture and efficient rendering, making it ideal for creating interactive web applications.

- **Next.js:** A React framework that enables server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG). Next.js simplifies the setup and allows for better performance and SEO optimization.

- **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework that provides a set of pre-defined styles and classes. Tailwind CSS allows for rapid styling and customization, making it easier to create a visually appealing and responsive user interface.
